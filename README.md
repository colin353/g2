## g2, an alternative terminal interface for git

Todo list:

 - [ ] Implement `g2 clean`
 - [ ] Finish implementing `g2 sync`
 - [ ] Don't require tmux
 - [ ] Terminal UI for branch selection
 - [ ] PR summary view (`g2 status`?)
 - [ ] More info on installation/usage
 - [ ] Demo GIF
 - [ ] When pushing a PR, change the last commit message to be the PR title?

Other stuff
 - [ ] Don't require tmux
 - [ ] Use libgit2 more instead of shell? Or maybe just shell and not libgit2?
 - [ ] Reduce dependencies?
 - [ ] Zsh/bash completions
